Description
===========
This software is a command line utility, a compiler written in D 1.0
for the D programming language (1.0 and 2.0).

How To Compile dil
==================
In order to compile dil you need to have:
 *) DMD 1.037 (http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0/changelog.html)
 *) Tango 0.99.7 (http://dsource.org/projects/tango/)
 *) DSSS 0.77 (http://dsource.org/projects/dsss/)

If you can't compile dil because you have a newer version of these programs
then report the problem to me, please (see Bugs section.)

Regarding Tango on Windows:
There is a regression in the Path class of Tango. You'll have to wait for
the next version, or try to compile with a previous version.

Regarding DSSS:
You have to make sure that the correct config file is used.
A default can be set in dsss/etc/rebuild/default.
Use dmd-posix-tango, dmd-win-tango, gdc-posix-tango or gdc-win-tango.
Note: I will ad a Python script that can compile dil or generate a makefile.

Compile dil:
# Change to the directory where you extracted dil.
$ cd dil/
# Type "dsss build".
$ dsss build
# The executable of dil is put into the bin/ directory.
$ ls bin/
# Output> dilconf.d  dil
# Run like this:
# On Linux:
$ bin/dil
# On Windows:
> bin\dil.exe

You should see the main help message printed in the console.

The language of the compiler messages can be set in the configuration file.
(Please, note that many messages are still untranslated.)
